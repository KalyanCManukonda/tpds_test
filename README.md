# Trust Platform Design Suite 2.0.x(Beta)
The Trust Platform Design suite helps you with:
 - Selecting the appropriate secure element family for your use case.
 - Generating an encrypted file to share your secure element's provisioning secrets with Microchip.
 - Provisioning the secure element with the given configuration and data.
 - Prototyping one of the use cases using C-based example projects and the [CryptoAuth Trust Platform](https://microchipdeveloper.com/boards:cryptoauth-trustplatform) hardware prototyping kit.

The Trust Platform Design Suite includes Anaconda (Python distribution) and Jupyter Notebook (open-sourced Python-based application). Jupyter Notebook communicates with a secure element on the CryptoAuth Trust Platform development board to provision it for specific use case. The CryptoAuth Trust Platform board includes all three Trust Platform devices: [Trust&GO](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trust-go) (pre-configured and pre-provisioned black box), [TrustFLEX](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trustflex) (pre-configured), and [TrustCUSTOM](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trustcustom) (full custom).

This repository provides the usecase template to get start with contributing an usecase to Trust Platform Design Suite. Refer to [Documentation](https://github.com/KalyanCManukonda/tpds_test/wiki) for details.
